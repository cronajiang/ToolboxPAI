# VirtualOA
VirtualOA is a graphical user interface based toolbox for conducting virtual experiments of optoacoustic imaging on a simplified model of a blood vessel embedded in a homogeneous medium [1]. The goal of this work is to provide a user-friendly virtual lab  to enhance the experimental design in optoacoustic imaging.

##  HOW TO START GUI
Run GUI_main.m in MATLAB environment.

## CROSS-PLATFORM COMPATIBILITY
This program has been so far tested successfully in different Operating Systems including windows 7 and OS X. In order to show the UI properly, the font size should be set ’100%’ or ’Default’ for the OS. The earliest MATLAB version tested so far is MATLAB 2013b.

The GUI is designed to be self-explained, but detailed documentation will come soon ...
